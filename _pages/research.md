My current research has three themes.

## Mechanistic understanding of sustainable aqueous batteries

Aqueous batteries emerge as attractive alternatives for large-scale energy storage by offering several advantages, such as non-flammability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental benignity. However, a notable drawback of aqueous electrolytes is the limited battery cell voltage. The narrow electrochemical stability window of water (1.23 V) triggers hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction during battery overcharging. Unlike some organic electrolytes, water does not form stabilizing electrode passivation layers and rapid battery failure is often observed.

My research team conducts physicochemical and electrochemical testing to elucidate the working mechanisms of model electrodes, such as layered oxide (vanadium pentoxide, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) and layered sulfide (titanium disulfide, TiS<sub>2</sub>), in sustainable aqueous alkali-ion batteries utilizing dilute electrolytes [1-3].

## Development and application of advanced *operando* characterizations

To investigate the battery performance degradation, researchers typically need to stop the cell, extract and prepare electrodes and electrolytes for *ex situ* analysis. However, such conditions typically distort the actual working environment of the sample under study. In contrast, *operando* techniques allow for continuous analysis without interrupting the cell, providing a more authentic understanding of transient changes occurring inside functioning batteries in real-time.

I possess extensive experience in developing *operando* techniques, including online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS, for gas evolution), electrochemical quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM-D, for solid deposition), online acoustic emission testing (AE, for mechanical degradation), and *operando* pH monitoring (for acid-base reaction) [1-3].

## High-throughput robotic screening of aqueous electrolytes

The integration of data-driven experimentation represents a significant advancement in battery research, substantially expediting progress by closing the experimentation–analysis loop. In contrast to the traditional manual screening of electrodes and electrolytes, automated processes hold the promise of improving both testing efficiency and reproducibility.

At UU, we have pioneered the development of ODACell, an automated platform for electrolyte formulation preparation and coin cell assembly, equipped with three robotic arms and a liquid-handling robot [1]. Our investigations demonstrate that cells assembled by the robots exhibit exceptional reproducibility and consistency. Presently, we are implementing Bayesian optimization to systematically screen additives for high-performance and low-cost aqueous Li-ion batteries.
