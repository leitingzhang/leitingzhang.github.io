Welcome to my site! I am a tenure-track assistant professor of the [Department of Chemistry - Ångström Laboratory](https://www.kemi.uu.se/angstrom), Uppsala University.

I obtained my PhD degree in Chemical Engineering from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the Collège de France (co-supervision) in 2018. Later, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Paul Scherrer Institute for three years, before joining the Department of Chemistry - Ångström Laboratory, Uppsala University as of 2021.
